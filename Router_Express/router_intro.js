    *** Express.js Router ***
        => A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes.
        => It's as a "mini-application" capable only of performing middleware and routing funnctions
        => We can use router as an arguments to app.use()
         or the arguments to another router's use() method.
         => The top-level express object has a Router() method
         that creates a 'new router object.'
